codeigniter-native-session
==========================

Utilizing PHP's native session instead of the cookie/db based session of codeigniter.

Installation
============

- Copy **config/session.php** to **application/config/session.php**
- Copy **libraries/MY_Session.php** to **application/libraries/MY_Session.php**

Done. 

The class mimics the Codeigniter's CI_Session class so all functions you are used to are available.
